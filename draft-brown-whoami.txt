1.  Introduction

   It is common for Domain Registries - whether country-code or generic,
   operating at the second-level or lower - to operate a directory
   service to allow interested parties to identify the entity to which a
   Domain has been allocated.  Typically, access to this directory
   service is provided using WHOIS [RFC3912] or RDAP [RFC7480] services.

   Consequently, Domain Registries have developed a model whereby the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5733] is used to collect
   large volumes of data - much of which could be considered Personal
   Data (see [RFC6973] for further discussion) - and then make this data
   available, with few restrictions, to anyone on the internet who might
   want it, for reasons both benign and malign.  This is especially the
   case for generic Top-Level Domain Registries, who are subject to
   policy obligations which, as of writing, require a uniform data model
   for registration data, and do not permit differentiated access to
   this data.

   This document proposes a decentralised alternative to traditional
   WHOIS directories.  To avoid the need for Domain Registries to
   collect registration data, it provides a means by which Domain
   Operators may, at their own discretion, publish their contact
   information in a machine-readable manner.

   It is contended that this approach eliminates the need for registries
   to maintain large databases of contact information, while still
   allowing supporting most of the uses to which such databases are put.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  Definitions

   In addition to the terms definied in this section, this document
   makes use of the terminology defined in [RFC7719].

   Domain:  The atomic unit of registration in a Domain Registry.

   Domain Operator:  TODO

   Domain Registry:  TODO

   Domain Registrant:  TODO

   Registration Data:  TODO

   Point of Contact:  TODO

2.  WHOAMI

   Domain Operators MAY choose to publish a Point of Contact (PoC) in
   conformance with this specification in vCard [RFC6350] format.  This
   PoC may be (a) published at a well-known URL (as decribed in
   Section 2.2) or (b) at a URL indicated by a URI record [RFC7553]
   published in the DNS (as described in Section 2.1).

   Implementers of software which consumes WHOAMI information SHOULD
   first perform a DNS query for the URI record for a Domain, falling
   back to the well-known URL if the query returns an error.

2.1.  DNS URI Record

   Domain Operators MAY publish the URL of their contact information as
   a URI record.  An example of such a record is below:

 _nicname._tcp.example.com. IN URI (
                             10 ; Priority
                             1 ; Weight
                             "https://example.com/whoami.vcf" ; Target )

   Note: the Owner Name, Priority, Weight, and Target in the above
   record are illustrative only.

Internet-Draft                Domain WHOAMI                December 2017


   The Service Tag of the URI record is constructed as per Section 4.1
   of [RFC7553], with the "_nicname" tag being derived from the "Who Is
   Protocol" entry in the "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port
   Number Registry ([RFC6335]).

2.1.1.  DNS URI Record with a data: scheme

   Domain Operators MAY publish a record with a "data:" scheme
   [RFC2397].  This allows the PoC data to be embedded in the URI record
   itself.  An example of such a URI is below:

data:text/vcard;charset=utf-8;base64,QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNClZFUlNJT046NC4wDQp
VSUQ6dXJuOnV1aWQ6NGZiZTg5NzEtMGJjMy00MjRjLTljMjYtMzZjM2UxZWZmNmIxDQpGTjt

tYTFlOWMxNGUwNTU2DQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=

2.2.  Well-Known URL

   Domain Operators MAY publish their contact information at the
   following URL:

   http://example.com/.well-known/whoami.vcf

   The "whoami.vcf" segment has been registered in the "Well-Known URI
   Registry" ([RFC5785]).
