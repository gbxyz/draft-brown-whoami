    <abstract><t>This document proposes a method by which the operator
    of a domain may publish their contact information in a discoverable
    and machine-readable format.</t></abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>This document specifies a protocol which provides a way for the
      operator of a domain name to publish their contact information in
      a discoverable and machine-readable format.</t>

      <t>It serves as a complementary service to WHOIS (<xref
      target="RFC3912"/>) and RDAP (<xref target="RFC7480"/>), and
      differs in that it relies on self-publication by the domain
      operator, rather than a centralised third party service.</t>

      <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
        in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title="WHOAMI Protocol">
      <t>Domain Operators MAY publish a WHOAMI Record
      in conformance with this specification. It may be published (a) at
      a URL indicated by a <xref target="RFC7553">URI record</xref>
      published in the DNS (as described in <xref target="dnsuri"/>), or
      (b) at a well-known URL (as described in <xref
      target="wellknown"/>).</t>

      <t>Software which consumes WHOAMI records SHOULD first perform a
      DNS query for the URI record for a domain, falling back to the
      well-known URL if the query does not return a positive result.</t>

      <section anchor="dnsuri" title="URI Record">
        <t>Domain Operators MAY publish the URL of their WHOAMI record
        as a URI record in the DNS. An example of such a record is
        below:</t>

        <figure><artwork>$ORIGIN example.com.
_nicname._tcp IN URI 10 1 https://example.com/whoami/whoami.vcf</artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>Note: the Owner Name, Priority, Weight, Target and URI in the
        above record are illustrative only.</t>

        <t>The Service Tag of the URI record is constructed as per
        Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7553"/>, with the "_nicname" tag
        being derived from the "Who Is Protocol" entry in the "Service
        Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry (see <xref
        target="RFC6335"/>).</t>

        <section title="URI Record with a data: scheme">
          <t>Domain Operators MAY publish a record with a "data:" scheme
          (<xref target="RFC2397"/>). This allows the WHOAMI record to
          be embedded in the URI record itself. An example of such a URI
          is below:</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork>data:text/vcard;charset=utf-8;base64,QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNClZFUlNJT046NC4w
DQpVSUQ6dXJuOnV1aWQ6NGZiZTg5NzEtMGJjMy00MjRjLTljMjYtMzZjM2UxZWZmNmIxD

0NzI3LTg4MDMtYTFlOWMxNGUwNTU2DQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=</artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>If a "data:" scheme is used, the MIME type of the data MUST
          be "text/vcard".</t>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section anchor="wellknown" title="Well-Known URL">
        <t>Domain Operators MAY publish their WHOAMI record at the
        following URL:</t>

        <figure>
        <artwork>http://example.com/.well-known/whoami/whoami.vcf</artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The "whoami" path segment has been registered in the
        "Well-Known URI Registry" (see <xref target="RFC5785"/>).</t>

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that web servers which support HTTP over
        Transport Layer Security (TLS, <xref target="RFC2818"/>) provide
        a 3xx redirect to the HTTPS version of this URL.</t>

        <t>Software which consumes WHOAMI records MUST follow 3xx
        redirections return in server responses.</t>

        <t>The Content-Type header of the server response MUST be
        "text/vcard".</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>WHOAMI provides no security capabilities above and beyond those
      provided by the underlying protocols it uses, namely DNS and
      HTTP.</t>

      <t>WHOAMI records in general will not be confidential: while HTTPS
      provides transport-layer security, unless some form of
      authentication is used, WHOAMI records will be freely available to
      anyone who requests them. Authentication of client requests is not
      covered by this document.</t>

      <t>The integrity of WHOAMI records served over DNS may be verified
      using DNSSEC validation. The use of TLS ensures that records
      served over HTTPS have not been modified in-transit.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>Since WHOAMI records are not private, the information included
      in a WHOAMI record is exposed to the public. Domain owners should
      therefore exercise caution when entering information into their
      WHOAMI record. For example, rather than publishing the contact
      informations of people, role-based contact information SHOULD be
      used instead.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This specification registers the "whoami" well-known URI in the
      "Well-Known URIs" registry as defined by <xref
      target="RFC5785"/>.</t>
      <t>URI suffix:  whoami</t>
