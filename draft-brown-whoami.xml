<section title="Introduction">
<t>It is common for <xref target="Definitions">Domain
Registries</xref> - whether
country-code or generic, operating at the second-level or
lower - to operate a directory service to allow interested
parties to identify the entity to which a <xref
target="Definitions">Domain</xref> has been
allocated. Typically, access to this directory service is
provided using <xref target="RFC3912">WHOIS</xref> or <xref
target="RFC7480">RDAP</xref> services.</t>

<t>Consequently, Domain Registries have developed a model
whereby the <xref target="RFC5733">Extensible Provisioning
Protocol (EPP)</xref> is used to collect large volumes of
data - much of which is Personal Data
(see <xref target="RFC6973"/> for further discussion) - and then make this
data available, with few restrictions, to anyone
who might want it, for reasons both benign and
malign. This is especially the case for generic Top-Level
Domain Registries, who are subject to policy obligations
which, as of writing, require a uniform data model for
<xref target="Definitions">Registration Data</xref>, and do not permit differentiated
access to this data.</t>

<t>This document proposes a decentralised alternative to
traditional WHOIS directories. To avoid the need for Domain
Registries to collect Registration Data, it provides a means
by which <xref target="Definitions">Domain Operators</xref>
may, at their own discretion (or in compliance with a Domain
Registry's policy requirements), publish their contact
information in a machine-readable manner.</t>

<t>It is contended that this approach eliminates the need for
registries to maintain large databases of contact information,
while still allowing supporting most of the uses to which such
databases are put.</t>

words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

<section title="Definitions" anchor="Definitions">
<t>In addition to the terms definied in this section, this document
makes use of the terminology defined in <xref target="RFC7719"/>.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Domain:">A domain object as specified in <xref target="RFC5731"/>.
In the DNS, this object corresponds to a Delegation of a "child" Zone from the
"parent" Zone operated by the Domain Registry.</t>

<t hangText="Domain Registry:">The entity which (a) operates a provisioning service
(such as EPP) for one or more Zones, the Authoritative server(s) for those Zones,
and optionally a WHOIS and/or RDAP service.</t>

<t hangText="Domain Registrant:">The entity to whom the operation and usage of a
Domain is assigned by a Registry.</t>

<t hangText="Domain Operator:">The entity (or entities) responsible for the
administration of the Zone in the DNS corresponding to Domain. The Operator of a
Domain may or may not also be its Registrant.</t>

<t hangText="Registration Data:">Metadata about a Domain object, such as its
creation, update, and expiration date, the nameservers to which it is delegated,
and the sponsoring registrar, plus a collection of zero or more Points of Contact
for the Domain Registrant, Domain Operator and/or other entities responsible for
the administration of a Domain.</t>

<t hangText="Point of Contact (PoC):">Contact information, including Contact Name,
Organisation Name, Postal Addres, email, voice and fax numbers, for a single
entity (which may be a natural person or legal entity).</t>

<t hangText="WHOAMI Record:">A Point of Contact in <xref target="RFC6350">vCard</xref> format.</t>

<section title="WHOAMI Protocol">
<t>Domain Operators MAY choose to publish a WHOAMI Record
in conformance with this specification. It may be published (a) at a URL indicated by a <xref
target="RFC7553">URI record</xref> published in the DNS (as
described in <xref target="dnsuri"/>), or (b) at a well-known URL (as described in
<xref target="wellknown"/>).</t>

<t>Software which consumes WHOAMI records
SHOULD first perform a DNS query for the URI record for a
Domain, falling back to the well-known URL if the query does not
return a positive result.</t>

<section anchor="dnsuri" title="URI Record">
<t>Domain Operators MAY publish the URL of their
WHOAMI record as a URI record in the DNS. An example of
such a record is below:</t>

<figure><artwork>$ORIGIN example.com.
_nicname._tcp IN URI 10 1 https://example.com/whoami/whoami.vcf</artwork>
</figure>

<t>Note: the Owner Name, Priority, Weight, and Target
in the above record are illustrative only.</t>

<t>The Service Tag of the URI record is constructed
as per Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC7553"/>, with
the "_nicname" tag being derived from the "Who Is
Protocol" entry in the "Service	Name and Transport
Protocol Port Number Registry (see <xref target="RFC6335"/>).</t>

<section title="URI Record with a data: scheme">
<t>Domain Operators MAY publish a record with a
<xref target="RFC2397">"data:" scheme</xref>.
This allows the WHOAMI record to be embedded in the
URI record itself. An example of such a URI
is below:</t>

<figure>
<artwork>data:text/vcard;charset=utf-8;base64,QkVHSU46VkNBUkQNClZFUlNJT046NC4w
DQpVSUQ6dXJuOnV1aWQ6NGZiZTg5NzEtMGJjMy00MjRjLTljMjYtMzZjM2UxZWZmNmIxD

0NzI3LTg4MDMtYTFlOWMxNGUwNTU2DQpFTkQ6VkNBUkQ=</artwork>
</figure>

<t>If a "data:" scheme is used, the MIME
type of the data MUST be "text/vcard".</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="wellknown" title="Well-Known URL">
<t>Domain Operators MAY publish their WHOAMI record
at the following URL:</t>

<figure>
<artwork>http://example.com/.well-known/whoami/whoami.vcf</artwork>
</figure>

<t>The "whoami" path segment has been registered in
the "Well-Known URI Registry" (see <xref
target="RFC5785"/>).</t>

<t>Software which consumes WHOAMI records
SHOULD follow 3xx redirections return in server
responses.</t>

<t>It is RECOMMENDED that web servers which support
<xref target="RFC2818">HTTP over
Transport Layer Security</xref> provide
a 3xx redirect to the HTTPS version of this
URL.</t>

<t>The Content-Type header of the server response
MUST be "text/vcard".</t>
